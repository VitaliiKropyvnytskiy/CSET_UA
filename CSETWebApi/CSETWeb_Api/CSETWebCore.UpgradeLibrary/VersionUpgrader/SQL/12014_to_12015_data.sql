There are multiple approaches for asset prioritization: forced ranking (sequential list), tiered ranking (e.g., all assets dealing with the flow of gas are tier 1, assets related to efficiency and monitoring are tier 2, and non-critical functions such as public relations and marketing are tier 3). Tiers should be based on defined criteria, such as importance of the asset to the function (e.g., safety, criticality of the asset to the delivery of the function, scarcity of the asset, how dependent other assets are on this asset) or the sensitivity of the data stored or processed by the asset. Prioritizations should be documented and ideally be agreed on by all involved stakeholders. They also should be communicated throughout the organization for use in incident response, risk management, and other relevant activities. As an example, virtualized assets may present increased risk due to issues such as asset sprawl and their unique characteristics (ease of capturing snapshots and storage of dormant virtual machines as files) and thus may pose higher risk to the function.

External or public sources typically provide information that is focused on common technologies that are used by a wide range of organizations. 

Vulnerabilities in the traditional sense include software bugs, omission errors, poor code construction, poor configuration, or processing failures. However, other risk exposures can create vulnerabilities that should be identified, processed, and responded to in a similar manner as vulnerabilities that are, for example, reported by software vendors or included in vulnerability catalogs. These types of vulnerabilities might include poor process performance, insider threats, and internal audit findings. These types of vulnerabilities should be included when considering identification of sources for vulnerability discovery. 
The identified sources of vulnerability information should align with the organization’s vulnerability identification and analysis needs.

There are several factors important to determining the potential impact of a vulnerability. The attributes of the vulnerability—what it can do, how it is exploited, the potential effects, and the potentially affected assets—should be carefully considered. Additionally, the individual characteristics of the IT and OT environment, the cybersecurity controls in place, and externally determined impact valuation such as NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores should also be considered.

For example, an ISAC publishes a bulletin notifying its members of a successful campaign targeting peer organizations that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability to a technology that is critical to the delivery of the organization’s function. Based on this information, existing controls, and risk posture, the organization deems the threat relevant. It invokes a decision process that results in declaration of a high-security operating state that trades off efficiency and ease of use in favor of increased security by blocking remote access and requiring a higher level of authentication and authorization for certain commands. On-going monitoring of internal systems and the threat environment is employed to determine when to return to the normal state of operation.

The risk register ensures that all identified risks are managed and that all staff involved in risk management activities are using the same risk information. The risk register may be used to manage risks individually or at the category level as defined in RISK-2d. For example, if an analyst identifies new indicators that change a previously identified risk, they can be added to the register and so that the information is available to all risk management stakeholders.

Remember that a legitimate (but potentially harmful) response to a risk is to accept the risk. The risk owner must have the authority to accept a risk.
For a risk owner to fully accept a risk, it is important that they understand the risk and the potential impacts that may occur if the risk is realized. To determine if a risk owner has adequate authority for accepting a risk, it may help to consider whether the potential impacts of the risk may extend beyond the scope of her or his authority. It may also help to consider whether the potential risk owner has adequate authority and resources within her or his purview to make appropriate changes if the risk is deemed outside of the organization''s risk tolerance.
Assignment of a risk to a risk owner may involve some form of written attestation of their ownership of the risk. Assignment of ownership at the right level of authority helps ensure that risk responses are effectively executed.

Risks may be categorized by source, type of threat, or another commonality. This analysis helps determine which risks merit the most attention given the organization’s unique operating circumstances, as well as how quickly they should be addressed.
A relative priority should be assigned to each risk (perhaps by category) using a consistent prioritization scheme. The intent of prioritization is to determine the cyber risks that most need attention because of their potential to affect operations. Typical components of an approach for risk prioritization include flow diagrams depicting the prioritization process, inputs to and outputs of the process, a list of relevant stakeholders involved in risk prioritization, and a scheme for ranking risks (high, medium, low, etc.).
Categorization and prioritization of risks help to right-size the number of risks being managed, as well as the amount of time and effort that an organization devotes to the management of identified cyber risks.

Risk responses should be developed as part of the risk management strategy. Risk responses can vary widely across organizations but typically include:
· risk avoidance—altering operations to avoid the risk while still providing the essential service
· risk acceptance—acknowledgment of the risk but consciously not taking any action (in essence, accepting the potential consequences of the risk)
· risk transfer—assigning the risk to a willing and able entity

· risk monitoring—performing further research and deferring action on the risk until the need to address the risk is apparent
Organizational risk response selection processes should clarify that it is not necessary to mitigate every identified risk. Risk avoidance, acceptance, or transfer should be considered in addition to mitigation.

This involves identifying the entity and documenting attributes such as role and position in the organization. 
Provisioning is performed for persons, devices, systems, and processes, whether internal or external to the organization. Thus, a vendor, agency, or business partner may be registered as an identity by the organization, as could a system or process from an external organization. In some cases, organizations may need to use shared identities, such as group accounts.
A best practice for provisioning is the identity profile. The profile contains all of the relevant information necessary to describe the unique attributes, roles, and responsibilities of the associated entity. The identity profile is generally initiated and approved by the organizational unit or line of business to which the entity belongs and where decisions about use of organizational assets can be made.

If an organization uses a matrix for determining the potential impact and priority of risks, it may develop a companion matrix that specifies credential and authentication requirements for each level of impact. For example, for remote access to a system with risks that could result in significant impact (level 4 of 5) and a high likelihood of occurrence (level 4 of 5), a commensurate requirement might establish that personnel must use strong credentials, multifactor authentication, or single use credentials. In situations where strong credentials (such as MFA) may be warranted, but are precluded by technological limitations, consider implementing the strongest available authentication configurations and implementing compensating controls if deemed appropriate based on risk and operational considerations.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) involves the use of two or more factors to achieve verification of an identity. Factors include (1) something you know, such as a password, (2) something you have, such as a token, (3) something you are, such as a fingerprint, or (4) something that indicates you are where you say you are, such as a GPS token. For the example above, personnel could be required to authenticate using a login ID, a password, and a token. 
Single use credentials may be implemented through a privileged access management (PAM) solution. Functionality provided by a PAM include role-based access to privileged credentials, automated rotation of passwords, integration with MFA, and auditing of privileged credential use.

These are specific examples of access that may pose higher risk to the function: 
· privileged accounts
· service accounts
· shared accounts (Use of these should be discouraged in general, but not possible in certain legacy IT and OT assets, where additional controls are appropriate such as stronger credentials as mentioned in this practice, strong physical access controls, or others.)
· remote access
· administrative accounts
· emergency access
· access to sensitive assets
· access to cloud or virtual asset management systems
· cryptographic key management accounts
· backup accounts
(Note that as requirements for stronger or multifactor credentials are established for more of these types of access, the higher the organization moves on the spectrum of maturity.)
Additionally, it is important to note that the word risk is being used in this practice in the general sense of the word and not intended to refer to any specific risks identified in the Risk Management domain of the C2M2. However, organizations should consider access to IT and OT assets and the controls applied to that access during the risk identification, analysis and response activities discussed in the Risk Management domain.

The period of inactivity must be established by the organization commensurate with potential risk. For example, temporary identities supplied to contractors might be appropriately disabled after a period of 30 days or less. An organization may implement this control by first monitoring last logon timestamp or other attributes to identify potential periods of inactivity. Using this information, identities that have been inactive for a defined period of time can be identified and disabled or removed if no longer needed. The efficiency of this activity may be improved by developing a list of accounts that by nature have long periods of dormancy but are also still necessary to meet operational requirements. While this practice may be enforced by automated means, it is important to carefully consider the impacts to operations prior to implementing automated deprovisioning.

For example, the logical access requirements for a specific asset might allow remote access by a vendor only during specified and preplanned maintenance intervals and might also require multifactor authentication for such access. As another example, it may be appropriate to apply additional logical access controls (such as peer review) to high-priority assets.
There are several models for access control, such as discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), policy-based access control (PBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC). Selection of an access control model will vary based on several factors, such as the operating environment and feasibility of implementation. For example, an organization may choose to implement an access control model that is supported by current infrastructure, such as RBAC, and plan for future implementation of a more advanced model, such as ABAC, as part of an acquisition of new infrastructure the supports additional access control capabilities.
Advanced security models, such as Zero Trust, may also inform the development of access requirements. For example, implementation of Zero Trust principles may include the ability to collect and use additional information (such as behavioral information, geolocation information, threat intelligence, and other contextual information) as part of access policy enforcement.

Organizations employ the principle of least privilege when considering the assignment of access rights and controls for specific duties and systems (including specific functions, ports, protocols, and services). The principle of least privilege also applies to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions and/or functions. Organizations consider the principle of least privilege in the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary. Organizations also apply the principle of least privilege to the design, development, implementation, and operations of IT and OT systems. Enforcing the principle of least privilege is an important consideration for implementation of Zero Trust principles.

Defining predefined states of operation typically requires use of detailed architectures or topologies, documentation and detailed understanding of your assets and their priorities (ASSET-1c, ASSET-1d), categories (ASSET-2c, ASSET-2d), and attributes (ASSET-1e, ASSET-2e).
The defined states might include criteria for invoking the state, such as who has the authority to trigger a state change in either direction, checklists that must be completed before moving from a degraded state to an operational state, how long the organization can survive in a particular state, or how the organization will conduct monitoring to determine when the criteria are met. Information from monitoring activities is used to trigger decisions about invoking the predefined states of operation. 
For example, if monitoring activities indicate an outage, this might trigger a manual process in which some analysis is done that determines that not all operations can be supported, specific decision makers must sign off on temporarily curtailing nonessential operation, and a predefined state is invoked in which certain assets are shut down. 
Other situations might make use of an automated process. For example, based on threat intelligence received through monitoring activities (SITUATION-3f), a ruleset triggers an upgrade of the threat level, which triggers invocation of a predefined state that shuts down critical assets. Another example of predefined states of operations could be limiting communications between IT and OT environments during a cybersecurity incident. 
As another example, high-risk situations may be identified that warrant additional logging, such as a safety-related emergency that requires an immediate elevation of access privileges, but they also may increase the verbosity of logging on affected devices.

Activities should be included in the plan for all phases of the incident lifecycle (for example, triage, escalation, handling, communication, coordination, and closure). Incident response plans should be comprehensive enough to address the high-level categories of incidents that may affect the organization. Incident response plans should also address potential incidents that may occur due to new vulnerabilities or technological advances that have a significant potential impact on the organization, such as vulnerabilities in commonly used technologies (e.g., MS17-010) and emerging technologies that would reduce the effectiveness of current cybersecurity controls (e.g., quantum computing).
As part of incident response planning organizations may consider what legal agreements may be necessary in different types of response scenarios (e.g., authorization for a federal employee to review a system, agreements related to obtaining assistance from outside organizations) and whether performing legal review in advance is warranted. Additionally, as technology used to complete operational activities continues to shift to more dispersed and mobile options, organizations may consider whether the assets involved in an incident will be physically available during response and what remote response capabilities may be necessary.

When planning for exercises, organizations should consider coordination with appropriate stakeholders (including third parties or vendors) for the different kinds of information, IT, and OT assets that may be within the scope for exercises such as virtualized assets, regulated assets, cloud assets, and mobile assets. A significant reliance on vendors during steady state operations may indicate an increased need for vendor support during incident response. Additionally, exercises provide an opportunity to identify and communicate the types of actions that should be avoided during response.

Therefore, to help ensure that continuity plans cover all the actions that need to be taken when certain types of cyber incidents occur, identify types of incidents that might realistically happen to your organization and cause significant disruption. Sources of information may include threat profile information, past incidents, current attack trends, vulnerability information, and cybersecurity alerts. Analysis techniques such as research, brainstorming, subject matter expert interview, and threat modeling may then be applied to identify the likely impacts of those incidents. Impact descriptions should name specific assets that would be affected by each type of incident. Develop as many continuity plans as needed to describe the actions that would need to be taken to deal with potential impacts and sustain operations during the disruption.

By identifying the subset of critical activities needed to support minimum operations, the organization can prioritize response activities and focus resources on restoring the assets that support those activities first. 
Function leaders must first decide what constitutes “minimum operations.” They might do this by identifying the operations that most directly affect the ability to achieve the function’s primary mission, or which operations their highest priority customers depend on. IT and OT operations teams should then identify which systems, technologies, data, staff, and processes are associated with maintaining those operations at normal functionality (including any dependencies on external functions or entities). IT and OT teams can then determine how minimum operations could be sustained in different types of degraded conditions (for example, if certain databases, staff, or external data feeds that the operations depend on are not available).
Additionally, organizations should consider what sustaining minimum operations may require in different situations. For example, in a pandemic situation where sudden wide-spread remote work is necessary, individuals may not have physical access to high-priority equipment.

Technical controls may be necessary for third parties that supply a service like remote maintenance of an asset. The organization may also consider management controls like acquisitions strategies that obscure the end use of an asset.
The following are examples of the types of requirements to consider: 
· controls and procedures for granting access to third parties
· specifications for the governance, protection, and destruction of data 
· whether the supplier will be developing software, and if so what secure coding practices must be used
· the knowledge and skills needed to perform the responsibilities assigned to third parties
· cybersecurity training that may be necessary prior to granting access to third parties
· logging, log retention, and monitoring
· incident and vulnerability notification, mitigation, and response coordination including timelines and thresholds
· incident response and information sharing
· controls governing connections to organization systems by third parties
· whether a diversity of software, assets, and suppliers is necessary to lower the risk of broad exploitation of specific vulnerabilities
Sources of information for the development of cybersecurity requirements for suppliers include analysis of previous cyber events (internal, external and "near miss"), brainstorming with internal stakeholders, interviews with cybersecurity experts, industry threat alerts, vulnerability announcements, the results of internal control reviews, vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and other research.

For each third-party agreement, the organization should establish a detailed set of specifications that the third party must meet. These should include the cybersecurity requirements that the organization expects the third party to meet. It is important that these specifications be thorough, detailed, definitive, adequate for use as criteria when selecting external entities, suitable as language in agreements with external entities, and appropriate for use as a basis for monitoring the performance of the third party. Ideally, legal and technical staff will work closely together in the development of these requirements. For example, technical staff may face challenges regarding configuration management when there is shared responsibility for the operation of assets. The organization may consider using contract language to ensure responsibility is properly assigned for addressing configuration issues.
Agreement language can be used to specify expectations and requirements for vulnerability or incident notification, including timelines, whether notification is required prior to public disclosure, and communication mechanisms to be used. Such specifications are often documented in service level agreements (SLAs) that are included in requests for proposals (RFPs). 
The agreement language should define what constitutes an event, incident, and vulnerability related to the delivery of the product or service. For example, a service outage in one region of the country that might affect other regions could be an event that the service provider should inform the organization about.

The activities are intentionally designed or described to serve the organization rather than being ad hoc. Documenting procedures helps ensure that they are repeatable and produce expected outcomes. The level of detail included in documentation should be a sufficient to enable consistent performance of domain activities by different people and new employees assuming relevant domain experience and sufficient on-board training.

An additional consideration may be whether the organization has implemented all practices it has targeted for implementation and whether additional resources are necessary to address potential gaps.
Adequate resources are provided in the form of people, funding, and tools to ensure that PROGRAM domain practices can be performed as intended. This includes both initiation and ongoing maintenance of a cybersecurity program. The performance of this practice can be evaluated by determining whether any desired practices have not been implemented due to a shortage of resources.
These are examples of people involved in PROGRAM domain activities:
· staff responsible for collection and analysis of threat information
· staff responsible for developing threat profiles
· staff responsible for performing vulnerability assessments
These are examples of tools that might be used in PROGRAM domain activities:
· techniques and tools for creating threat profiles
· tools for performing vulnerability assessments
· vulnerability databases
Adequacy of resources should be determined on an ongoing basis through regular reviews of the domain program and reviews of domain resources in budgeting activities. It is a common point of concern that there is not enough time to complete cybersecurity program activities. This is addressed primarily through increasing staff and secondarily through increasing funding and tools.
When determining the adequacy of staff, also consider whether the cybersecurity program has sufficient capacity so that the individuals that make up the program can regularly attend training, implement and maintain tools, and respond to incidents while conducting day-to-day operations and meeting the cybersecurity objectives of the organization.', NULL, NULL, 28, 352, 12, NULL, NULL, 552, N'', N'', NULL, NULL, NULL)

These are examples of how to formalize responsibility and authority for PROGRAM domain activities:
· defining roles and responsibilities in policies
· developing position descriptions and conducting associated performance management activities
· including process tasks and responsibility for these tasks in position descriptions
· developing and implementing contractual instruments (including service level agreements) with external entities to establish responsibility and authority for performing PROGRAM domain tasks on outsourced functions
