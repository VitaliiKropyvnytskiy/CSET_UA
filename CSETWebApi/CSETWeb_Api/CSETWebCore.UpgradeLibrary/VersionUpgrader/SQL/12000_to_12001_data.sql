Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers).

Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses).&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities&#8212;such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers&#8212;are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. &#10;Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).&#10;Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.&#10;Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization&#8217;s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points.</div><div><strong>For further information, see related controls</strong></div><div class="mb-2">CA-2, CA-7, CA-8, CM-2, CM-4, CM-6, CM-8, RA-2, RA-3, SA-11, SA-15, SC-38, SI-2, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SR-11.</div>' WHERE [Mat_Question_Id] = 5133

For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.&#10;Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3)(b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.</div><div><strong>For further information, see related controls</strong></div><div class="mb-2">AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11.</div>' WHERE [Mat_Question_Id] = 5137

Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. &#10;Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).&#10;Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.&#10;Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">B<span>ug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization&#8217;s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points.</span></div><div><strong>For further information, see related controls</strong></div><div class="mb-2">CA-2, CA-7, CA-8, CM-2, CM-4, CM-6, CM-8, RA-2, RA-3, SA-11, SA-15, SC-38, SI-2, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SR-11.</div>' WHERE [Mat_Question_Id] = 5144

Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities&#8212;such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers&#8212;are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">&#160;Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).&#10;Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities.&#160;</div><div class="mb-2">Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.&#10;Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization&#8217;s needs.</div><div class="mb-2">Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group.

These external organizations may even have a stated role in the communications plans or the service continuity of the organization. In addition, some regulatory and legal entities may require ongoing communications as evidence that an organization has taken appropriate actions to prepare for specific threats such as natural disasters and terrorism.

The need to create or enable a capability from the composition of distributed components can magnify the relevancy of these principles. In particular, the translation of security policy from a stand-alone to a distributed system or a system-of-systems can have unexpected or emergent results.

Refer to 1.1 above for additional guidance</div><div><br/></div></div><div><b>Why is this Control critical?</b></div><div><br></div><div><div>A complete software inventory is a critical foundation for preventing attacks. Attackers continuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software that can be remotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or attachment with a vulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs and bots that give the attacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also use this access to move laterally through the network. One of the key defenses against these attacks is updating and patching software. However, without a complete inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot determine if they have vulnerable software, or if there are potential licensing violations.</div><div><br></div><div>Even if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows an enterprise to guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some sophisticated attackers use &#8220;zero-day exploits,&#8221; which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to have a patch released from the software vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an enterprise can implement temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch is released.</div><div><br></div><div>Management of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks. An enterprise should review its software inventory to identify any enterprise assets running software that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise asset may come installed with default software that creates a potential security risk and provides no benefit to the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand,&#160;assess, and manage all software connected to an enterprise&#8217;s infrastructure.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Procedures and tools</b></div><div><br></div><div>Allowlisting can be implemented using a combination of commercial allowlisting tools, policies, or application execution tools that come with anti-malware suites and popular operating systems. Commercial software inventory tools are widely available and used in many enterprises today. The best of these tools provides an inventory check of hundreds of common software used in enterprises. The tools pull information about the patch level of each installed program to ensure that it is the latest version and leverage standardized application names, such as those found in the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) specification. One example of a method that can be used is the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Additional information on SCAP can be found here: <span>https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-126r3.pdf</span></div><div><br></div><div>Features that implement allowlists are included in many modern endpoint security suites and even natively implemented in certain versions of major operating systems. Moreover, commercial solutions are increasingly bundling together anti-malware, anti-spyware, personal firewall, and host-based IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), along with application allow and block listing. In particular, most endpoint security solutions can look at the name, file system location, and/or cryptographic hash of a given executable to determine whether the application should be allowed to run on the protected machine.

Further, these security configuration updates need to be managed and maintained over the life cycle of enterprise assets and software. Configuration updates need to be tracked and approved through configuration management workflow process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for compliance, leveraged for incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is important to on-premises devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud environments.</div><div><br></div><div>Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to provide flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore, the presence of default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the enterprise that is using the software, rather than the service provider.

3. Assessment determinations should be documented with determination of applicability, implementation plan, reasoning for determinations. Implementation of patches or other vulnerability remediation may depend on applicability, risk to the asset requiring the patch/remediation and risk of business or operational disruptions related to implementation.

Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.</div><div><br/></div></div><b>Why is this Control critical?&#160;</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged from attackers who are looking for vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and gain access. Defenders must have timely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches, security advisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their environment to identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding and managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention, and resources.</div><div><br></div><div>Attackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of vulnerabilities more quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in time from a vulnerability being known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize which vulnerabilities are most impactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited first due to ease of use. For example, when researchers or the community report new vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy patches, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the new vulnerability to the enterprise, regression-test patches, and install the patch.</div><div><br></div><div>There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to a vulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have developed an exploit to this vulnerability referred to as a &#8220;zero-day&#8221; exploit. Once the vulnerability is known in the community, the process mentioned above starts. Therefore, defenders must keep in mind that an exploit might already exist when the vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes vulnerabilities might be known within a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix) for weeks, months, or years before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that there might always be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other controls to mitigate.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an entire enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting the enterprise&#8217;s business or mission.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Procedures and tools&#160;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of enterprise assets. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities across an enterprise, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that map vulnerabilities to one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration and platform classification schemes and languages: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE&#174;), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE), Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL&#174;), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and/or Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF).

Sometimes audit records are the only evidence of a successful attack. Attackers know that many enterprises keep audit logs for compliance purposes, but rarely analyze them. Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious software, and activities on victim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers sometimes control victim machines for months or years without anyone in the target enterprise knowing.</div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently: system logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show various system process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and take less configuration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events&#8212;when a user logged in, accessed a file, etc.&#8212;and take more planning and effort to set up.</div><div><br></div><div>Logging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been detected, log analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack. Complete logging records can show, for example, when and how the attack occurred, what information was accessed, and if data was exfiltrated.

Adversaries continue to evolve and mature, as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits and bypasses to security controls. Even if security tools work &#8220;as advertised,&#8221; it takes an understanding of the enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be effective. Often, misconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool capabilities give enterprises a false sense of security.</div><div><br></div><div>Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous monitoring that allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents quickly. Enterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience more false positives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and responding to these threats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure and leveraging humans in the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical for large or heavily targeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to prevent, detect, and quickly respond to cyber threats before they can impact the enterprise. This process will generate activity reports and metrics that will help enhance security policies, and support regulatory compliance for many enterprises.</div><div><br></div><div>As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for weeks, months, or years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive situational awareness is to increase the speed of detection and response. This is critical to respond quickly when malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when sensitive data is compromised to reduce impact to the enterprise.</div><div><br></div><div>Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify and catalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their IOCs that will help the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or incidents.

This informs the development of a security architecture, technical controls, logging, monitoring, and response procedures.</div><div><br></div><div>At the core of this process is a trained and organized team that implements processes for incident detection, analysis, and mitigation. These capabilities could be conducted internally, or through consultants or a managed service provider. Enterprises should consider network, enterprise asset, user credential, and data access activities. Technology will play a crucial role to collect and analyze all of the data, and monitor networks and enterprise assets internally and externally to the enterprise. Enterprises should include visibility to cloud platforms that might not be in line with on-premises security technology.</div><div><br></div><div>Forwarding all important logs to analytical programs, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, can provide value; however, they do not provide a complete picture. Weekly log reviews are necessary to tune thresholds and identify abnormal events. Correlation tools can make audit logs more useful for subsequent manual inspection. These tools are not a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks.</div><div><br></div><div>As this process matures, enterprises will create, maintain, and evolve a knowledge base that will help to understand and assess the business risks, developing an internal threat intelligence capability. Threat intelligence is the collection of TTPs from incidents and adversaries.

More recent examples include ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly, due to one of their service providers being locked down, causing disruption to business. Or worse, if directly connected, a ransomware attack could encrypt data on the main enterprise.</div><div><br></div><div>Most data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party service providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Business Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials. Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not managed within the enterprise are transferred to entities outside the enterprise.</div><div><br></div><div>While reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades, there is not a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers are being audited by their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their own productivity. This is because every enterprise has a different &#8220;checklist&#8221; or set of standards to grade the service provider. There are only a few industry standards, such as in finance, with the Shared Assessments program, or in higher education, with their Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their own measurements.</div><div><br></div><div>While an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting companies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications, smaller firms are often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider contracts with additional parties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a third-party uses a fourth-party platform or product to support the main enterprise.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Procedures and tools&#160;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Most enterprises have traditionally used standard checklists, such as ones from ISO 27001 or the CIS Controls.

There should also be language in the contracts to hold them accountable if there is an incident that impacts the enterprise.</div><div><br></div><div>There are third-party assessment platforms that have an inventory of thousands of service providers, which attempt to provide a central view of the industry, to help enterprises make more informed risk decisions.

They are part of a comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement. They can also reveal process weaknesses, such as incomplete or inconsistent configuration management, or end-user training.</div><div><br></div><div>Penetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS Control 7. Vulnerability testing just checks for presence of known, insecure enterprise assets, and stops there. Penetration testing goes further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far an attacker could get, and what business process or data might be impacted through exploitation of that vulnerability. This is an important detail, and often penetration testing and vulnerability testing are incorrectly used interchangeably. Vulnerability testing is exclusively automated scanning with sometimes manual validation of false positives, whereas penetration testing requires more human involvement and analysis, sometimes supported through the use of custom tools or scripts. However, vulnerability testing is often a starting point for a penetration test.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Another common term is &#8220;Red Team&#8221; exercises. These are similar to penetration tests in that vulnerabilities are exploited; however, the difference is the focus. Red Teams simulate specific attacker TTPs to evaluate how an enterprise&#8217;s environment would withstand an attack from a specific adversary, or category of adversaries.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Procedures and tools&#160;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Penetration testing starts with the reconnaissance of the enterprise and environment, and scanning to identify the vulnerabilities that can be used as entries into the enterprise. It is important to make sure all enterprise assets are discovered that are in-scope, and not just rely on a static list, which might be outdated or incomplete. Next, vulnerabilities will be identified in these targets. Exploits to these vulnerabilities are executed to demonstrate specifically how an adversary can either subvert the enterprise&#8217;s security goals (e.g., the protection of specific sensitive data) or achieve specific adversarial objectives (e.g., the establishment of a covert Command and Control (C2) infrastructure). The results provide deeper insight, through demonstration, into the business risks of various vulnerabilities. This can be against physical access controls, network, system, or application layers, and often includes social engineering components.</div><div><br></div><div>Penetration tests are expensive, complex, and potentially introduce their own risks. Experienced people from reputable vendors must conduct them. Some risks include unexpected shutdown of systems that might be unstable, exploits that might delete or corrupt data or configurations, and the output of a testing report that needs to be protected itself, because it gives step-by-step instructions on how to break into the enterprise to target critical assets or data.</div><div><br></div><div>Each enterprise should define a clear scope and rules of engagement for penetration testing. The scope of such projects should include, at a minimum, enterprise assets with the highest valued information and production processing functionality. Other lower-value systems may also be tested to see if they can be used as pivot points to compromise higher-value targets. The rules of engagement for penetration test analyses should describe, at a minimum, times of day for testing, duration of test(s), and the overall test approach. Only a few people in the enterprise should know when a penetration test is performed, and a primary point of contact in the enterprise should be designated if problems occur. Increasingly popular recently is having penetration tests conducted through third-party legal counsel to protect the penetration test report from disclosure.</div><div><br></div><div>The Safeguards in this CIS Control provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve enterprise security, and should be a part of any penetration testing.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage restrictions while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or may impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process.

Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing and trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending on the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments. This control does not apply to external systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools including, for example, web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example, scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Scanning tools that facilitate interoperability include, for example, products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP) validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include, for example, the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.

The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements.
