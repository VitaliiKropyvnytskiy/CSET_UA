Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD Common Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote), non-privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk.

When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks.

Many&#10;document, and email applications provide for this capability. Typically, the&#10;receiver will need to have the same application to de-crypt the message or&#10;document as you used to encrypt it. If you need to send them a password or key,&#10;give it to them via phone or other method. Never send it in the same email as&#10;the encrypted document.</span><b></b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Patch Management:</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Patch Management is an easy concept to understand, but a&#10;challenge to execute. Patch management is the process for identifying,&#10;acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for products and systems. Patches&#10;correct security and functionality problems in software and firmware. Patch&#10;management is required by various security compliance frameworks, mandates, and&#10;other policies. For example, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-532 requires the&#10;SI-2, Flaw Remediation security control, which includes installing&#10;security-relevant software and firmware patches, testing patches before&#10;installing them, and incorporating patches into the organization&#8217;s&#10;configuration management processes. Another example is the Payment Card&#10;Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS), which requires that the latest&#10;patches be installed and sets a maximum timeframe for installing the most&#10;critical patches.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Vendors&#10;routinely issue patches or security updates to address vulnerabilities found on&#10;institutions systems.&#160; <b>Best Practice&#10;CIS Safeguard 7.4 </b>recommends updates to be done at least monthly, or more&#10;frequently. The latest patches should be deployed to critical systems as soon&#10;as possible. If critical patches are not applied timely, a hacker could exploit&#10;these vulnerabilities to access sensitive data. The effective patch management&#10;plan should include a patching schedule; a condition or set of rules or standards&#10;for applying those patches in a timely manner based upon the criticality and&#10;risk, testing environment, and some reporting function that covers which&#10;patches have and have not been applied. Testing software and firmware updates&#10;can identify compatibility and instability issues that could cause serious&#10;operational disruptions.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Keeping up with&#10;patches in a timely manner is challenging to manage even for less complex&#10;entities.&#160; Management should implement&#10;automated patch management systems and&#160;software&#160;to ensure that&#10;all&#160;network&#160;components (e.g.,&#160;servers,&#10;VMs,&#160;routers,&#160;switches, mobile&#160;devices, and&#160;firewalls) are&#10;appropriately updated.<span>&#160;</span> Some systems may be manually patched.&#160; </p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Patch&#10;management solutions can produce a variety of reports that include showing&#10;patch compliance, exceptions, and days outstanding. Missing critical patches to&#10;servers, desktops, laptops, and other devices should be remediated as soon as&#10;possible unless there is an approved exception.&#160;&#10;If patch management is outsourced to a vendor, then vendor should be&#10;providing patch status reports to the credit union management.&#160; Vulnerability scans help detect&#10;vulnerabilities for which there are patches available that may not have been&#10;installed.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&#160;</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Passwords:</b></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Strong passwords help mitigate credential guessing and&#10;cracking. Password complexity is determined by length and the combination of&#10;unpredictable characters. For example, according to CIS Safeguard, Control 5.2&#10;(Use Unique Passwords), implementation should include at a minimum, an&#10;8-character password for accounts using MFA and a 14-character password for&#10;accounts not using MFA.&#160; Delete or&#10;disable any inactive accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where&#10;supported. </p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Access controls also include limiting the number of password&#10;attempts, typically three, before a user is locked out. Controls also prohibit&#10;the reuse of passwords. This means users are not allowed to enter a new&#10;password based on alteration of one character. Instead the system requires an&#10;entirely new character string.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">The NIST 7621, Small Business Information Security, The&#10;Fundamentals, provides the following information regarding the use of strong&#10;passwords:</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><i>For systems or applications that have important&#10;information, use multiple forms of identification (called &#8220;multi-factor&#8221; or&#10;&#8220;dual factor&#8221; authentication). For example, when a user logs in with a&#10;password, they may be sent a text message with a code they have to enter as&#10;well. Biometrics (e.g. fingerprint scanners) and other devices may be used but&#10;can be expensive and difficult to install or maintain.</i></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Many devices come with default administration passwords &#8211;&#10;these should be changed immediately when installing and regularly thereafter.&#10;Default passwords are easily found or known by hackers and can be used to&#10;access the device. The manual or those who install the system should be able to&#10;show you how to change them.</i></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Passwords to devices and applications that deal with&#10;business information should not be re-used. If a hacker gains access to one&#10;account, they will have access to all others that share that password. It may&#10;be difficult to remember a number of different passwords so a password&#10;management system may be an option. However, these systems place all passwords&#10;into one place which may be lost or compromised. Carefully compare password&#10;management solutions before purchasing</i>.&#8221;</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">Passwords are often the only barrier between you and your&#10;personal information. There are several <span>techniques</span> attackers can use to help guess or&#10;&#34;crack&#34; passwords. However, choosing strong passwords and keeping&#10;them confidential can make it more difficult for others to access information.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Passwords that do not change for long periods of&#10;time allow hackers time to crack them and may be shared and become common&#10;knowledge to an individual user&#8217;s coworkers. Therefore, passwords should be&#10;changed at least every 3 months. Consider configuring systems and devices to&#10;require users to change their passwords every 3 months if possible</span><span>.</span></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal">NCCIC/US-CERT recommends users take the following actions:</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#10;</span></span>Use multi-factor authentication when available.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#10;</span></span>Use different passwords on different systems and&#10;accounts.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#10;</span></span>Don''t use passwords that are based on personal&#10;information that can be easily accessed or guessed.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#10;</span></span>Use the longest password or passphrase&#10;permissible by each password system.</p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#10;</span></span>Don''t use words that can be found in any&#10;dictionary of any language.</p>', N'Examination Statements', N'', 17, 1, 10, NULL, NULL, 2547, N'', NULL, NULL, NULL)
