Frequent password change policies force people to write down their password; or worse, choose easy-to-guess passwords.   Passwords typed in multiple times a day are more vulnerable to shoulder surfing (observation by a nearby individual) or becoming victimized by malware interception (e.g., key loggers, etc.).

2. Resource Restrictions. Access to specific functions is restricted by never allowing users to request information, functions, or other resources for which they do not have access.Three major types of resource restrictions are: menus, database views, and network devices.
3. Encryption. Encrypted information can only be decrypted, and therefore read, by those possessing the appropriate cryptographic key. While encryption can provide strong access control, it is accompanied by the need for strong key management. Follow the guidance in Section 5.10.1.2 for encryption requirements if encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism.

1. Passwords shall be a minimum of twenty (20) characters in length with no additional complexity requirements imposed (e.g., ASCII characters, emojis, all keyboard characters, and spaces will be acceptable).

2. Password Verifiers shall not permit the use of a stored “hint” for forgotten passwords and/or prompt subscribers to use specific types of information (e.g., “What was the name of your first pet?”) when choosing a password.

3. Verifiers shall maintain a list of “banned passwords” that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list may include, but is not limited to:
a. Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses
b. Dictionary words
c. Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’)
d. Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof

4. When processing requests to establish and change passwords, Verifiers shall compare the prospective passwords against the “banned passwords” list.

5. If the chosen password is found to be part of a “banned passwords” list, the Verifier shall:
a. Advise the subscriber that they need to select a different password,
b. Provide the reason for rejection, and
c. Require the subscriber to choose a different password.

6. Verifiers shall limit the number of failed authentication attempts that can be made as described in Section 5.5.3 Unsuccessful Login Attempts.

7. Verifiers shall force a password change if there is evidence of authenticator compromise or every 365 days from the last password change.

8. Verifiers shall use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel when requesting passwords to protect against eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

9. Verifiers shall store passwords in a manner that is resistant to offline attacks by salting and hashing the password using a one-way key derivation function when stored.
a. The salt shall be at least 32 bits in length.
b. The salt shall be chosen arbitrarily so as to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes.
Note: Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive.

10. For each subscriber, Verifiers shall protect stored salt and resulting hash values using a password or PIN.', '<span>Advanced Authentication Use Cases</span><div><br></div><div><div>Use Case 1 - A Local Police Department Authentication Control Scenario</div><div>During the course of an investigation, a detective attempts to access Criminal Justice&#160;<span>Information (CJI) from a hotel room using an agency issued mobile broadband card.

NOTE: Subsequent versions of approved cryptographic modules that are under current review for FIPS 140-2 compliancy can be used in the interim until certification is complete.

EXCEPTIONS:

1. See Sections 5.13.1.2.2 and 5.10.2.

2. Encryption shall not be required if the transmission medium meets all of the following requirements:
a. The agency owns, operates, manages, or protects the medium.
b. Medium terminates within physically secure locations at both ends with no interconnections between.
c. Physical access to the medium is controlled by the agency using the requirements in Sections 5.9.1 and 5.12.
d. Protection includes safeguards (e.g., acoustic, electric, electromagnetic, and physical) and if feasible countermeasures (e.g., alarms, notifications) to permit its use for the transmission of unencrypted information through an area of lesser classification or control.
e. With prior approval of the CSO.

Examples:

1. Isolate the host from the virtual machine. In other words, virtual machine users cannot access host files, firmware, etc.
2. Maintain audit logs for all virtual machines and hosts and store the logs outside the hosts’ virtual environment.
3. Virtual Machines that are Internet facing (web servers, portal servers, etc.) shall be physically separate from Virtual Machines (VMs) that process CJI internally or be separated by a virtual firewall.
4. Drivers that serve critical functions shall be stored within the specific VM they service. In other words, do not store these drivers within the hypervisor, or host operating system, for sharing. Each VM is to be treated as an independent system – secured as independently as possible.

The following additional technical security controls shall be applied in virtual environments where CJI is comingled with non-CJI:

1. Encrypt CJI when stored in a virtualized environment where CJI is comingled with non- CJI or segregate and store unencrypted CJI within its own secure VM.
2. Encrypt network traffic within the virtual environment.

The following are additional technical security control best practices and should be implemented wherever feasible:

1. Implement IDS and/or IPS monitoring within the virtual environment.
2. Virtually or physically firewall each VM within the virtual environment to ensure that only allowed protocols will transact.
3. Segregate the administrative duties for the host.

4. If the person appears to be a fugitive or has an arrest history without conviction, the CSO or his/her designee shall review the matter to determine if access to CJI is appropriate.

5. If the person already has access to CJI and is subsequently arrested and or convicted, continued access to CJI shall be determined by the CSO.

6. If the CSO or his/her designee determines that access to CJI by the person would not be in the public interest, access shall be denied and the person''s appointing authority shall be notified in writing of the access denial.

7. The granting agency shall maintain a list of personnel who have been authorized unescorted access to unencrypted CJI and shall, upon request, provide a current copy of the access list to the CSO.
